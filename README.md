## Features

- **Navigation**
    - At the top of the page, the navigation shows the logo is in the top left and the name of the company is in the middle to stand out.
    - The other navigation links are to the right: Men's Clothes, Women's Clothes & Kids' Clothes which all link to different sections in different pages.
    - The navigation is underlined and highlighted in white to show the user which page he is in at the moment to guide him where he would like to go.

- **The Header**
	- The header shows the various famous brands sold in the company to attract the eye of the user as he lands on the page.
 	- I stuck to using black and white to keep it consistent and not distracting it from the main focus.
 	- This section provides clear images of brands and its logos that are well known to the user with a big title to attract the user

- **The Main Page**
	- The Main Page in the Home Section: this Main Page shows the various cateogories of clothes sold as well as what different types of clothes from the clothing, footwear, accessories etc.
![Main Page ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74bc880a-50b6-4df9-833d-b67961377561)
  - The Main Page in the Men's, Women's & kids' Clothes Section: this Main Page for these three sections allows the user to shop and find all the different items in front of him with its headings to see what he wants.
  - A user can scroll to the next item whether it is an item of clothing or footwear or accessory using the carousels with clear display of the product using the image, title and price.
  - The only difference with the three sections is the images and its product along with its information from the title and price of the product.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
=======

- **The Enquiry Form**
	-  This enquiry Form uses a modal to display a form to contact the company directly, this consists the name, email, number and the message of the user so the company can respond back to the user via email or text message
 ![Enquiry Form](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9873e182-c210-4bff-bb9e-f9d52f5f42eb)


- **The Success Page**
	- This success page displays the confirmation of the enquiry form which has been submitted successfully which is displayed with a big writing to allow the user to receive affirmation with manners of saying "Thank you!".
 	- it also shows a sentence that the form has been submitted successfully as well as a button to return back to home page as there is no further need to remain on the success page after the form has been submitted to give extra satisfaction to the user that his form has been succesfully sent to the company and to return to the original page for any products he is interested in.

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature which I would love to implement is the Search option to allow a user to directly search what he is looking for to save time from looking and scrolling.

## Testing
- I have tested my project as a user of the website. i have made sure that each page i am on is displayed in the nav bar using styles. This includes the styling i have made on the color of the font whilst hovering over it in each page to display the option to go to another section.
- I have made sure that the buttons on the cards in the home page has the shaddow to display it like a button which will take me to the section where it mentioned it will go.
- I have tested the carousels if they work with all of the products i have coded into it and there has been no bugs and errors in the carousels.
- I have tested the form using the modal that is in the footer and made sure it does not submit until all the inputs has been filled in correctly. I have made sure it takes me to a success page to confirm the user that the form has been submitted.
- I have made sure the carousels look suitable for different browser sizes and screen sizes by changing the column in different sizes. However there should have been more space between the two carousels before changing the coloumn which there wasn't as the carousels had to squash and overlap between each other before going to another coloumn.
- I have used flexbox to wrap the cards and carousels as the screen size gets smaller.
- A problem which i have discovered is the nav bar with the "kids' clothes" writing overflows outside of the background colour of the nav bar. This was shocking as i did not recognise this whilst testing in different screen sizes which may have been because of hastiness in testing which let me missing some problems and not focusing on the testing for every detail.

## Validator Testing

- HTML
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

## Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
=======
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)
 
## Unfixed Bugs

- A bug which was a problem whilst testing was using the media queries to make a break point for the carousels at a certain breakpoint. this was not completed as it did not go as expected when making the fix when i used the media queries in a separate CSS file since bootstraps built in carousel may have some limitations for its responsiveness. Despite this, i have decided to do research which took some time and limited in what i coulf have done and decided to leave it unfinished and to solve it in the future.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

<<<<<<< HEAD
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
The live link can be found here - https://hamza789987.github.io/Project-1/

## Credits

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

## Content

The text for the Home page was taken from Wikipedia Article A
Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken from Specific YouTube Tutorial
The icons in the footer were taken from Font Awesome

## Media

The photos used on the home and sign up page are from This Open Source site
The images used for the gallery page were taken from this other open source site
Congratulations on completing your Readme, you have made another big stride in the direction of being a developer!

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so itâ€™s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through this article by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood
When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

For example, instead of naming an image used â€˜image1.pngâ€™ consider naming it â€˜landing_page_img.pngâ€™. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:

Writing Your Best Code
HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices
Google HTML/CSS Style Guide

## Credits
- **Content**
 	-  In the home page, I have taken inspiration from the home page of JD in their website for some of their sections like the "brands you love", and the cards made for the Men's, Women's and Kids' section in the home page.
  -  In the Footer, I have taken credit from the code institute website for the boardwalk games to and i appreciated splitting the footer into two sections, one for the contact information and the other for the opening times which has a clear bright table to show the opening times of the company.
  -  For the name of the company, I asked ChatGPT for a list of titles for the clothing company and i enjoyed hearing "The Wardrobe Hub" with the items that is includes.
  - For the icons in the footer, i used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
 
- **Media**
	- The photos used for all of this website was taken from google and i used it as a jpg to display with no issues in the pixels
 	- For the logo, I used a logo maker with specific colours of black and white to complement the colours of the website overall.
  	-  For the icons in the footer, i used font awesome.
  	-  For the pictures of the different Brands, i used the [SVG's](https://www.svgrepo.com/) and linked to it using the relative path
