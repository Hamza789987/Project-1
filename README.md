# The Wardrobe Hub

The Wardrobe Hub website is a landing page to shop for clothes for all ages.
The Wardrobe Hub offers many different brands for men, women and kids.

Users of this website will be able to easily head to the products they want by having the categories clearly in front of them to know which category to shop as well as mentioning what is sold in each category.
Users can also contact the business and send a message if they have any enquiries.

## Features

- **Navigation**
    - At the top of the page, the navigation shows the logo is in the top left and the name of the company is in the middle to stand out.
    - The other navigation links are to the right: Men's Clothes, Women's Clothes & Kids' Clothes which all link to different sections in different pages.
    - The navigation is underlined and highlighted in white to show the user which page he is in at the moment to guide him where he would like to go.

- **The Header**
	- The header shows the various famous brands sold in the company to attract the eye of the user as he lands on the page.
 	- I stuck to using black and white to keep it consistent and not distracting it from the main focus.
 	- This section provides clear images of brands and its logos that are well known to the user with a big title to attract the user

- **The Main Page**
	- The Main Page in the Home Section: this Main Page shows the various cateogories of clothes sold as well as what different types of clothes from the clothing, footwear, accessories etc.

  - The Main Page in the Men's, Women's & kids' Clothes Section: this Main Page for these three sections allows the user to shop and find all the different items in front of him with its headings to see what he wants.
  - A user can scroll to the next item whether it is an item of clothing or footwear or accessory using the carousels with clear display of the product using the image, title and price.
  - The only difference with the three sections is the images and its product along with its information from the title and price of the product.

- **The Success Page**
	- This success page displays the confirmation of the enquiry form which has been submitted successfully which is displayed with a big writing to allow the user to receive affirmation with manners of saying "Thank you!".
 	- it also shows a sentence that the form has been submitted successfully as well as a button to return back to home page as there is no further need to remain on the success page after the form has been submitted to give extra satisfaction to the user that his form has been succesfully sent to the company and to return to the original page for any products he is interested in.

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature which I would love to implement is the Search option to allow a user to directly search what he is looking for to save time from looking and scrolling.

## Testing
- I have tested my project as a user of the website. i have made sure that each page i am on is displayed in the nav bar using styles. This includes the styling i have made on the color of the font whilst hovering over it in each page to display the option to go to another section.
- I have made sure that the buttons on the cards in the home page has the shaddow to display it like a button which will take me to the section where it mentioned it will go.
- I have tested the carousels if they work with all of the products i have coded into it and there has been no bugs and errors in the carousels.
- I have tested the form using the modal that is in the footer and made sure it does not submit until all the inputs has been filled in correctly. I have made sure it takes me to a success page to confirm the user that the form has been submitted.
- I have made sure the carousels look suitable for different browser sizes and screen sizes by changing the column in different sizes. However there should have been more space between the two carousels before changing the coloumn which there wasn't as the carousels had to squash and overlap between each other before going to another coloumn.
- I have used flexbox to wrap the cards and carousels as the screen size gets smaller.
- A problem which i have discovered is the nav bar with the "kids' clothes" writing overflows outside of the background colour of the nav bar. This was shocking as i did not recognise this whilst testing in different screen sizes which may have been because of hastiness in testing which let me missing some problems and not focusing on the testing for every detail.

## Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)
 
## Unfixed Bugs

- A bug which was a problem whilst testing was using the media queries to make a break point for the carousels at a certain breakpoint. this was not completed as it did not go as expected when making the fix when i used the media queries in a separate CSS file since bootstraps built in carousel may have some limitations for its responsiveness. Despite this, i have decided to do research which took some time and limited in what i coulf have done and decided to leave it unfinished and to solve it in the future.


## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are the following:
- Go to the GitHub repository you want to deploy your project and navigate to the Settings tab.
- Click the Settings tab on your repository and scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar and select it. Under Branch, Select the main branch.
- Select the main branch and click Save to confirm.
- To verify try refreshing the page as you would receive a link under "GitHub pages" which will take me to my site to show my website is live

## Credits
- **Content**
 	-  In the home page, I have taken inspiration from the home page of JD in their website for some of their sections like the "brands you love", and the cards made for the Men's, Women's and Kids' section in the home page.
  -  In the Footer, I have taken credit from the code institute website for the boardwalk games to and i appreciated splitting the footer into two sections, one for the contact information and the other for the opening times which has a clear bright table to show the opening times of the company.
  -  For the name of the company, I asked ChatGPT for a list of titles for the clothing company and i enjoyed hearing "The Wardrobe Hub" with the items that is includes.
  - For the icons in the footer, i used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
 
- **Media**
	- The photos used for all of this website was taken from google and i used it as a jpg to display with no issues in the pixels
 	- For the logo, I used a logo maker with specific colours of black and white to complement the colours of the website overall.
  	-  For the icons in the footer, i used font awesome.
  	-  For the pictures of the different Brands, i used the [SVG's](https://www.svgrepo.com/) and linked to it using the relative path
